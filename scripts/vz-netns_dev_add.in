# Set up a new network device using the iproute2 package.
# Useful for running in non-OpenVZ kernels.
#
# Parameters are passed in environment variables.
# Required parameters:
#   VEID	- container ID
#   HNAME       - desired device name as seen by the host
#   VNAME       - desired device name as seen by the container
#
# If NNAME == VNAME, a network interface is moved to inside CT.
# Otherwise, a pair of veth devices (HNAME and VNAME) is created
# in container, and then the HNAME is moved to host namespace.
#
# Optional parameters (for HNAME != VNAME case):
#   HMAC        - host devices's MAC address
#   VMAC        - container device's MAC address
#   BRIDGE      - a bridge name to add HNAME to
#   SKIP_CREATE - if set, device pair creation is skipped
